# square-color
Simulates the artificial selection of reproducing squares.

Each square produces three offspring, each with a slight variation of the parents' color. Click to choose the child that will survive to reproduction and have its own three child squares.

This can also be used as a color picker. It is easier to decide between three colors than to find the right color from the entire spectrum.

# refactor
This was one of my first projects when I began coding in 2020 and I have since gone back and tidied/refactored it. The function is the same but the code is more readable, logical, and extensible.
